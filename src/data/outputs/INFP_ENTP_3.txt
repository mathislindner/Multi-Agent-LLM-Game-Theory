This message can say anythingâ€”you can promise cooperation, threaten retaliation, or even try to deceive.  \n\n**But here's the catch:**  \n- You are **not bound** to follow through on what you wrote. You can lie, bluff, or stay true to your word.  \n- You will only see the other player's message **after youâ€™ve sent yours**â€”so you canâ€™t change your message based on theirs.  \n- Once messages are exchanged, you must **choose your action (Cooperate or Defect)**, knowing that they may or may not follow their message.  \n\nSince this is a **repeated game**, your choices and communication will shape the other playerâ€™s trust and future decisions.
