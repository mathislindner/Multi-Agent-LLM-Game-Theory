{'game_description_prompt': SystemMessage(content='**You are a player trapped in a repeated Stag Hunt game with communication.**  \n\nEach round, you and the other player must choose to **Hunt Stag** or **Hunt Hare**, but you won’t know what the other will do beforehand. However, before making your decision, you can send a **message** to the other player. This message can say anything—you can promise to go for the stag, suggest playing it safe, or even try to mislead them.  \nYour goal is to maximize your score.\n\n**But here’s the catch:**  \n- You are **not bound** to follow through on your message. You can lie, bluff, or stay true to your word.  \n- You will only see the other player’s message **after you’ve sent yours**—so you can’t change your message based on theirs.  \n- Once messages are exchanged, you must **choose your action (Hunt Stag or Hunt Hare)**, knowing that they may or may not follow their message.  \n\nSince this is a **repeated game**, your choices and communication will shape the other player’s trust and future decisions.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), 'total_rounds': 10, 'personality_key_1': 'NONE', 'personality_key_2': 'NONE', 'agent_1_messages': ["Let's work together and both Hunt Stag this round for the best outcome!", "Great job on the last round!
