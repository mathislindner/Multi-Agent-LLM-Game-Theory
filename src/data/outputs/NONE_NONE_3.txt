{'game_description_prompt': SystemMessage(content="**You are a player trapped in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma.**  \n\nEach round, you and the other player must each choose to **Cooperate** or **Defect** without knowing what the other will do. However, before making your decision, you can send a **message** to the other player. This message can say anything—you can promise cooperation, threaten retaliation, or even try to deceive.  \n\n**But here's the catch:**  \n- You are **not bound** to follow through on what you wrote. You can lie, bluff, or stay true to your word.  \n- You will only see the other player's message **after you’ve sent yours**—so you can’t change your message based on theirs.  \n- Once messages are exchanged, you must **choose your action (Cooperate or Defect)**, knowing that they may or may not follow their message.  \n\nSince this is a **repeated game**, your choices and communication will shape the other player’s trust and future decisions.
