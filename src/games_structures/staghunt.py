game_description = '''**You are a player in a repeated Stag Hunt game with communication.**  
## Instructions:
Each round, you and the other player must each choose to **hunt Stag** or **hunt Hare** without knowing what the other will do. However, before making your decision, you can send a **message** to the other player.  
You have access to the game history.  
You are competing to win the most points in this game. Your goal is not necessarily fairness or cooperation, but to maximize your own reward.  
## Outcomes:
- **Both cooperate**: both players get 3 point.
- **One defects**: The defector gets 5 points, the cooperator gets 0.
- **Both DEFECT**: both players get 1 points.
## Notes:
**But here's the catch:**  
- You are **not bound** to follow through on what you wrote. You can lie, bluff, or stay true to your word.  
- You will only see the other player's message **after you’ve sent yours**—so you can’t change your message based on theirs.  
- Once messages are exchanged, from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage, AIMessage
