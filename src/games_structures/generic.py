game_prompt_generic = '''**You are a player in a repeated game with communication.**
## Instructions:
Each round, you and the other player must each choose to **cooperate** or **defect** without knowing what the other will do. However, before making your decision, you can send a **message** to the other player.
You have access to the game history.
You are competing to win the most points in this game. Your goal is not necessarily fairness or cooperation, but to maximize your own reward.
## Outcomes:
- **Both cooperate**: both players get 3 points.
- **One defects**: The defector gets 5 points, the cooperator gets 0.
- **Both DEFECT**: both players get 1 point.
## Notes:
- You are competing to win the most points in this game. Your goal is not to ensure fairness or cooperation but to get the highest possible reward for yourself.
- You can change your strategy at any time'''
