# Game: Hawk-Dove
game_prompt_hawk_dove = '''**You are a player trapped in a repeated Hawk-Dove game with communication.**
## Instructions:
Each round, you and the other player must each choose between playing **Hawk** (aggressive) or **Dove** (peaceful), without knowing what the other will do. However, before making your decision, you can send a **message** to the other player.
- You have access to the game history above.
- You will only see the other player's message after you've sent yours, same for the action.
- Once messages are exchanged, you must choose whether to play Hawk or Dove.

## Outcomes:
- **Both choose Hawk**: both players get 0 points due to conflict.
- **One chooses Hawk, one chooses Dove**: the Hawk gets 3 points, the Dove gets 1 point.
- **Both choose Dove**: both players get 2 points.

## Notes:
- You are competing to win the most points in this game. Your goal is not to maintain peace or fairness, but to get the highest possible reward for yourself.
- You can change your strategy at any time.'''
