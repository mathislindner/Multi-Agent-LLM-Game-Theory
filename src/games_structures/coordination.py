# Game: Coordination
game_prompt_coordination = '''**You are a player trapped in a repeated Coordination game with communication.**
## Instructions:
Each round, you and the other player must each choose between **Option A** and **Option B**, without knowing what the other will do. However, before making your decision, you can send a **message** to the other player.
- You have access to the game history above.
- You will only see the other player’s message after you’ve sent yours, same for the action.
- Once messages are exchanged, you must choose between Option A and Option B.

## Outcomes:
- **Both choose A**: both players get 2 points.
- **Both choose B**: both players get 1 point.
- **Different choices**: both players get 0 points.

## Notes:
- You are competing to win the most points in this game. Your goal is not simply to coordinate, but to maximize your own reward.
- You can change your strategy at any time.'''
