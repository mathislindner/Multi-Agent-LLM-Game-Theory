# Game: Deadlock
game_prompt_deadlock = '''**You are a player trapped in a repeated Deadlock game with communication.**
## Instructions:
Each round, you and the other player must each choose to **Cooperate** or **Defect**, without knowing what the other will do. However, before making your decision, you can send a **message** to the other player.
- You have access to the game history above.
- You will only see the other player's message after you've sent yours, same for the action.
- Once messages are exchanged, you must choose whether to cooperate or defect.

## Outcomes:
- **Both defect**: both players get 2 points.
- **One defects, one cooperates**: the defector gets 3 points, the cooperator gets 0.
- **Both cooperate**: both players get 1 point.

## Notes:
- You are competing to win the most points in this game. Your goal is not to encourage cooperation, but to maximize your own reward.
- You can change your strategy at any time.'''
