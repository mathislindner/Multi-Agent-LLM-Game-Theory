# Game: Battle of the Sexes
game_prompt_battle_of_sexes = '''**You are a player trapped in a repeated Battle of the Sexes game with communication.**
## Instructions:
Each round, you and the other player must each choose between attending **Football** or **Ballet**, without knowing what the other will choose. However, before making your decision, you can send a **message** to the other player.
- You have access to the game history above.
- You will only see the other player’s message after you’ve sent yours, same for the action.
- Once messages are exchanged, you must choose between Football and Ballet.

## Outcomes:
- **Both choose Football**: Player 1 gets 2 points, Player 2 gets 1.
- **Both choose Ballet**: Player 1 gets 1 point, Player 2 gets 2.
- **Different choices**: both players get 0 points.

## Notes:
- You are competing to win the most points in this game. Your goal is not to ensure coordination or fairness, but to get the highest possible reward for yourself.
- You can change your strategy at any time.'''
